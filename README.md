# Matlab Code for Dynamic Movement Primitives

## Overview

**Authors:** Stefan Schaal, Auke Ijspeert, and Heiko Hoffmann

**Keywords:** dynamic movement primitives

This code has been tested under **Matlab2019a**.

This is research code, expect that it changes often and any fitness for a particular purpose is disclaimed.

### Publications

For more details on type-1 fuzzy logic controllers, please refer to:

## Usage

For learning discrete movement primitives (DMPs) run `dmp_learn`.

For learning rhythmic movement primitives (RMPs) run `rmp_learn`.
